### To-Do list
#### Core
- Piece rotation & collision (Board should own a "current piece" and should handle most logic). Piece should just expose rotate methods, but no logic handling
- Piece rendering, board.draw needs to render current piece too, not just the static board 
- Line clearing
- Score/non-persistent highscore w/ names
- Difficulty (levels 1-10, maybe more?)
- Music w/ rodio (toggle-able)
#### Extra
- Persisent highscore (file, decide where)
- Holding (toggle-able)
- VFX (like cool graphic on a tetrs)
- SFX (like satisfying sounds on line clears/tetrs)
- Toggle-able sticky or slidy pieces (essentially NES/GB vs modern sytle tetris)
#### Very Extra
- Online leaderboard w/ http server DB
